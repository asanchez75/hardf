Current Status: early port of N3.js

Basic PHP library for RDF1.1. Currently provides simple tools (an Util library) for an array of triples/quads.

For now, EasyRDF is the best high-level PHP library (naming of this library is a contraction of "Hard" and "RDF").

## Triple Representation

We use the triple representation in  PHP ported from NodeJS N3.js library. Check https://github.com/RubenVerborgh/N3.js#triple-representation
